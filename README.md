# blackjack

This was coded at a 4-hour hackathon-style event run by Zappos. As you can see the code is far from clean and does not reflect my normal, relaxed coding style.

The server was written by Max Keener of Zappos.com, and [https://github.com/keemax](lives here).

## "Awards"
Interestingly enough, this blackjack client won 1st place at a Zappos coding challenge, with a 40.83 win percentage.
